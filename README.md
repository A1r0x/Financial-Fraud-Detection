# Real-Time Fraud Detection System

This project implements a real-time fraud detection system that monitors financial transactions for suspicious activity, leveraging AWS services for scalability and resilience. The system processes transactions from a Kafka stream, checks for anomalies or suspicious behavior, and sends alerts for potential fraud cases. It uses AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, ElastiCache for Redis, Amazon SNS, and Glue.

## Architecture
The system uses the following components:
1. **AWS Glue** to transform and stream transactions to Kafka.
2. **Kafka/MSK** to stream transactions in real-time.
3. **AWS Lambda** as a processing engine that detects fraud by analyzing transaction data.
4. **ElastiCache for Redis** to store user session data for low-latency access.
5. **DynamoDB** to store all transaction history and flagged transactions.
6. **Amazon SNS** to send alerts when suspicious transactions are detected.

## Features
- **Real-time Processing**: Analyzes each transaction as it arrives.
- **Fraud Detection Logic**: Flags transactions based on user behavior (e.g., amount thresholds, location changes).
- **Low-Latency Data Access**: Uses Redis to quickly access frequently updated data like recent user locations.
- **Alert System**: Sends alerts via SNS to notify security teams of suspicious transactions.

## Technologies Used
- **AWS Glue** for ETL and streaming transactions to Kafka.
- **Kafka/MSK** for real-time transaction streaming.
- **AWS Lambda** for serverless processing of transactions.
- **Redis (ElastiCache)** for caching user transaction patterns.
- **DynamoDB** for durable storage of transaction history.
- **SNS** for alert notifications.
- **Python** as the primary programming language.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- An AWS account with access to Lambda, DynamoDB, ElastiCache, SNS, and Glue.
- Python 3.8 or higher.
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions.

### Deployment Steps
1. **Create an SNS Topic**:
   - Go to the SNS console and create a topic for fraud alerts.
   - Add relevant subscriptions (email, SMS, etc.) to receive alerts.

2. **Set up DynamoDB Tables**:
   - Create a `transaction_history` table to store all transactions.
   - Create a `flagged_transactions` table to store transactions flagged as suspicious.

3. **Deploy Lambda Function**:
   - Package the function and dependencies in a ZIP file:
     ```bash
     cd lambda_function
     zip -r lambda_function.zip .
     ```
   - Upload `lambda_function.zip` to AWS Lambda.
   - Configure the Lambda handler to `lambda_function.lamda_handler`.

4. **Configure Redis (ElastiCache)**:
   - Create an ElastiCache Redis cluster in the same VPC as your Lambda function.
   - Update your Lambda environment with the Redis endpoint.

5. **Configure Glue Job**:
   - Set up Glue to extract and transform transaction data from a data source.
   - Stream the transformed data to your Kafka topic (`transaction_stream`).

6. **Configure Kafka/MSK**:
   - Ensure Kafka is set up to handle incoming transactions and trigger the Lambda function.

### Environment Variables
Configure the following environment variables in the Lambda console:
- `SNS_TOPIC_ARN`: ARN of the SNS topic for fraud alerts.
- `ELASTICACHE_REDIS_ENDPOINT`: Endpoint for the Redis instance.

## Testing
### Local Testing
1. Test individual functions (e.g., `is_fraudulent`, `send_fraud_alert`) locally with mock data.
2. Use a local Redis server (or test Redis instance) to verify caching logic.

### AWS Testing
1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Run unit tests for each part of the Lambda function to verify fraud detection logic.
2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Trigger the Lambda with sample transactions from Kafka/MSK to simulate end-to-end flow.
   - Verify transactions are stored in DynamoDB and alerts are sent via SNS.

### Monitoring and Logs
- Use **CloudWatch** to monitor logs and Lambda metrics (duration, error count).
- Set up CloudWatch alarms for critical metrics, such as high error rates or increased processing time.

## Usage
1. Stream transactions into Kafka/MSK.
2. Lambda processes each transaction, applies fraud detection, and:
   - Stores transaction history in DynamoDB.
   - Flags and stores suspicious transactions in a separate DynamoDB table.
   - Sends an alert via SNS if fraud is detected.

## Future Improvements
- **Machine Learning Models**: Integrate AWS SageMaker for more complex fraud detection models.
- **Scalability**: Add auto-scaling configurations for DynamoDB and ElastiCache for higher transaction volumes.
- **Enhanced Fraud Detection Logic**: Add more detailed fraud rules based on user behavior analytics.
